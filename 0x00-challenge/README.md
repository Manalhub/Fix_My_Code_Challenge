## Tasks

### 0. FizzBuzz

In this task, you'll take a look at an existing implementation of FizzBuzz in Python and identify and correct the issue. The output of the program is not as expected, and your goal is to fix it. To get started, review the provided source code in [0-fizzbuzz.py](./0-fizzbuzz.py) and make the necessary adjustments to achieve the desired output.

### 1. Print Square

For this task, you'll work with an existing implementation of printing a square in Javascript. The current code is not functioning correctly, and your task is to modify it to print squares of the specified size. Check out the code in [1-print_square.js](./1-print_square.js) and make the necessary corrections to produce the expected square output.

### 2. Sort

Here, you'll explore a Ruby implementation of sorting arguments. The provided code is not working as intended, and your challenge is to fix it. Take a look at the code in [2-sort.rb](./2-sort.rb) and apply the necessary changes to ensure correct sorting behavior.

### 3. User Password

In this task, you'll dive into a Python implementation of a User class. There's an issue with the `is_valid_password` method, and you need to rectify it. Examine the provided code in [3-user.py](./3-user.py) and make the required adjustments to ensure that the tests run without errors.

### 4. Double Linked List

Finally, you'll tackle a C implementation of a Double Linked List. The code provided is not producing the expected output, and you need to troubleshoot and fix the issues. Review the source code files, compile them as necessary, and identify and correct the problems to achieve the desired behavior.
